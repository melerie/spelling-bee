# Spelling Bee

I love the spelling bee game and thought I would like to create a personal project for the game I like.
I got the word list for the game from a reference project [here](https://github.com/lzha97/spelling_bee/blob/master/words.json).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
